      "content": "Two Ghosts of Cryptography: Why Nicolas van Saberhagen Is Even More Phantom Than Satoshi Nakamoto\n\n➡️Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nPublished the Bitcoin whitepaper on October 31, 2008, through the mailing list [cryptography@metzdowd.com]\n\nHe(?) remained publicly active for over two years: 500+ posts on Bitcointalk.org under the username “satoshi,” dozens of private emails with developers such as Gavin Andresen, Hal Finney, and Mike Hearn, and direct commits to Bitcoin’s original code repository.\n\nHis last known communication was in April 2011—an email to Gavin Andresen. After that, he vanished, leaving behind an enormous technical and historical footprint.\n\n➡️Nicolas van Saberhagen\n\nThe anonymous creator of the CryptoNote protocol, which forms the basis for the design of the #Monero blockchain, published two versions of his(?) whitepaper:\n\n* Version 1: December 2012\n* Version 2: October 2013\n\nUnlike Satoshi, he showed no public activity whatsoever afterward: no forum posts, no emails, no GitHub commits. His(?) identity and activity remain entirely unknown.\n\nThere are rumors of a distorted-voice Skype call in 2015, but no verifiable recording or transcript has ever surfaced.\n\nWhile Satoshi continued developing Bitcoin for years after releasing his paper, van Saberhagen disappeared immediately after publishing, as if he had dropped his cryptographic scrolls and dissolved into the network.\n\nBonus / a curious detail: the pseudonym “Nicolas van Saberhagen” may be a cryptic reference—combining Nicolas Flamel (the medieval alchemist) and Fred Saberhagen (author of Dracula novels). It could loosely translate as “the alchemist who knows.” There’s no proof this was intentional, but it fits the legend of someone who clearly never wanted to be found.",

      "content": "Monero defies Gresham's Law: The Monero Paradox\n\nGresham’s Law states that “bad money drives out good.”\n\nWhen two forms of money coexist, people tend to spend the one they perceive as worse and hoard the better one. \n\nClassic example: when gold coins and paper notes circulated together, people spent the paper and hid the gold.\n\nThat’s where Monero’s paradox appears.\nMonero is, in many ways, better money than Bitcoin:\n─It’s more fungible — every unit is identical and untraceable.\n─It has default privacy, making it genuinely usable as money.\n─The Tail emission ensures long-term stability and miner incentives without risking collapse.\n\nBut it’s also worse money in the speculative sense.\nIt doesn’t attract traders or funds because of its #privacy, and its price doesn’t skyrocket during bubbles — its value lies in real-world utility, not hype.\n\nSo #Monero challenges Gresham’s Law:\npeople neither hoard it out of greed nor spend it out of fear — they use it because it works.\n\nFor the next 16 years, it will even be scarcer than Bitcoin, yet its design favors circulation over accumulation.\n\nIn short:\nMonero is Bitcoin perfected — money stripped of financial fetishism, restored to its true purpose: the exchange of value.",

But he has a point honestly.\n\nPeople have given me shit for this but it’s why I say if you’re in #Bitcoin, KYC and following the law + taxes is being a lawful citizen, despite the government being corrupt and filled with massive piles of dog shit. You’re not going to outsmart AI when it comes to this + a public blockchain.\n\nWant to solve your privacy? Then use #Monero, it’s that simple.\n\nRealism > Idealism. Be pragmatic. Tate can be cringe and retarded sometimes but he’s obviously intelligent and it’s obvious this shit was going to happen. Look at what’s going on in Europe.\n\nBitcoin solves money, Monero solves privacy. The anarchist libertarian wet dream many of us on here have just isn’t going to happen and it isn’t reality nor will it ever be.

      "content": "Monero and the Battle for Decentralization: from CryptoNight to RandomX\n\nIn 2013, the CryptoNote protocol introduced CryptoNight, an algorithm built to democratize mining: anyone could mine with a regular CPU or GPU, avoiding the ASIC dominance that centralized Bitcoin’s hash power.\n\n#Monero adopted it in 2014, but by 2017–2018, manufacturers like Bitmain had developed ASICs capable of breaking that balance. The community fought back with regular hard forks and variants such as CryptoNightV7 and CryptoNightR, defending decentralization through constant adaptation.\n\nThe real breakthrough came in 2019 with RandomX, designed by the community (led by tevador and hyc). This new algorithm uses random code execution and memory-intensive operations, making ASIC development economically unfeasible.\n\nAs of 2025, Monero remains CPU-friendly, proving that #privacy and #Decentralization aren’t slogans — they’re coded into the protocol itself.",

It shares many of Bitcoin's design features, like proof of work etc., but adds zero knowledge cryptography and obfuscation methods to make sure all transactions and wallet balances are private and that no UTXO has traces of prior UTXOs.\n\nSo, going back to your tainted cash analogy, \"Monero fixes this\" while Bitcoin actually makes it worse. However, Lightning networks can provide some degree of privacy from individuals (but not institutions). \n\nI'm still bullish and a supporter of Bitcoin as permissionless hard money, but also believe \"privacy coins\" like Monero and Zcash are essential for maintaining \"digital sovereignty.\"\n\nBTW, Monero is up this week/month/year as people are starting to understand the importance of what I elaborated above.\n\n99.9% of coins are rightfully considered \"shitcoins\" but Monero isn't one of them, IMO. \n\n\"I'm not trying to convert you. I'm just explaining my joke, which, admittedly, wasn't very funny.  \n\n",

Point is relative to Bitcoin, monero actually has a proportionally higher effective hashrate. \n\nThat does effective hashrate mean? Well they can't be compared one to one directly since Bitcoin is ASIC mined and Monero RandomX. For equal cost, Bitcoin mining will produce a hugely greater number of hashes than Monero by design. Moneros mining is designed to be most efficient in CPUs with no ability to create specialized ASICs.\n\nAccording to that users calculations, Monero's effective hashrate was about 4% of Bitcoins at the time. You'd have to calculate these numbers today relative to the market cap difference but at the time of the post Nov 3 2021 Monero market cap was $4.9 Billion and Bitcoin at 1.2T placing Monero market cap at 4.08% (Data from coinlore.com).\n\nI encourage someone to recalculate this today I'm curious if the security budget is still 1-1 with Bitcoin relative to market cap as it was Nov 3 2021 but suffice to say Monero is not massively more insecure compared to Bitcoin. It is proportionally secure.",

I think the transparent option is kinda cool and can serve as a buffer against regulation (as witnessed by the fact that they're still on several major exchanges). I can see some potential benefits and issues with this approach. \n\n4) Reasonable, but a slightly discouraging precedent (not very cypherpunk) \n\nThey're obviously trying to navigate the regulatory landscape and this requires compromises.\n\nHowever, from my perspective, it's a good thing that there's another project with an alternate design and regulatory strategy. \n\n5) This is FUD in my opinion. The odds are infinitesimal - effectively zero.\n\nThey've also had some fuck ups with cryptography and transparency. They're now under new management, so we'll see how that goes. \n\nUltimately, I still think it's legit (at least for now). \n\nIs it better than Monero? Given all of the above, probably not. \n\n",

      "content": "To give a contrasting viewpoint on why Monero is a necessity is because Bitcoin's Fiat Culture has made adding important changes to Bitcoin difficult, for example, look at the C*re vs. Kn*ts debate, this is something that should in theory be smaller than the block wars but has become exaggerated to such a degree that people are calling each other Nazis, and Pedophiles over this 🙄.\n\nNow imagine ACTUAL protocol changes, if Bitcoin had privacy even opt in like the way Z-cash does it instead of the way Monero that's by default, many people would complain about shitcoining Bitcoining, and how privacy elements are a \"vector for hidden inflation bugs\", even though the proof of outputs was visible already.\n\nOr imagine the supply, and miner incentivization, going back to C vs. K, the C side says blocks are essentially empty, and miners need incentives but K says \"FUCK MINERS\" Literally, Bitcoiners would flip out if the 21 million rule was ever changed, even though the real circulating supply is actually only 10.5 million, or less trending down to zero extrapolated over time.\n\nEven if we assume that deflation is good as an appreciation mechanism, I'm assuming you've heard of Gresham's law, and as you've seen with \"HODL'ing\" that over time Bitcoin will fail to circulate since people will expect its value to be even higher in the future, continually delaying purchases that otherwise would be made.\n\nNow, I will be honest that yes Bitcoin does appreciate more overtime (in theory, as it's hard to say how much trading volume is speculative vs. appreciative) than Monero does, however Monero has been staying stable, and gradually appreciating too as its use case increases.\n\nWhen compared to Bitcoin, yes Monero is \"Bad Money\" but when compared to most other currencies it's good money because it has a predictable inflation rate unlike others that have unpredictable inflation rates.\n\nI think Monero has to exist as a contrary view on economic principles, and privacy.\n\nBitcoin was once the Dark web money because Pseudonymity was private enough until the people in charge found a way to deanonymize Bitcoin with institutional capture.\n\nBitcoin has essentially, and quietly become institutional collateralization rather than a MoE, even coinmarketcap, no longer lists Bitcoin as MoE.\n\nSo given all that, I view Monero as a better spending tool, and I think as a business, you could easily integrate this while still saving in a SoV, since the friction with spending Monero is less than spending Bitcoin privately is.\n\nhttps://i.nostr.build/pfL2JuQ8ZAvkBhIH.jpg\nhttps://i.nostr.build/vyS9cAB08nBWiTsX.png",

So yes I used other \"trusted\" nodes by people I knew for Sparrow, Monero and Ashigaru...\nTangent, but look at LN. It is inherently a system where you build trust and have to trust people. You don't open channels to untrusted or unreliable people...\nE.g., I \"trusted\" your Olympus node and kept it full for spending, yet you still closed my channel to you... Now I use WoS to collect tips rather than fussing with the trust model of LN...\nAnd let's be fair, spending with monero is way better than managing Lightning... Hence why only custodial LN has the UX needed to get adoption. And the capacity of LN is laughable small.",

Unless you bought it 2015 or prior this is garbage advice, take away the first 5 of the last 10 years and this return is reduced incredibly. Ie look at 5yr chart vs gold no real return since 2021.\n- there is a second best it’s call Monero and it outperforms Bitcoin in bear market \n- becoming sovereign should be the goal everything else is noise, bitcoin is one piece of the puzzle not the entire puzzle as some claim.\n- what the fuck do I know it’s just like my opinion man.",
